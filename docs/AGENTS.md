See the [README](README.md) for overall project scope

# Design guidline
- Use at little Regex as possible.
- Do not add complexity only for backward compatibility unless the user explicitly asks for it.
- Do not hack your way to a solution. Understand the problem and find a proper solution. Many times, a better understanding of the grammar or the tree will help you find a better solution.
- For parser/analyzer behavior, follow the global **Extraction Contract (All Parsers)** in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
